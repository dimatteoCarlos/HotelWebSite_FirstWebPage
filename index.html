          Rica as a national park in 1978 and located about 500 kilometers off
          the country's Pacific coast, the volcanic island is also recognized as

          One dish that defines Cocos Islands cuisine is ayam pangang, which
          Bilda makes using her grandmother's recipe. ‚ÄúAyam is chicken and
          pangang means grilling, but I needed to call it something different
          here, so people understood what it was, so we call it lemon chilli
          chicken,‚Äù she explains

          Cocos Island is renowned for its scuba diving. The Costa Rican waters
          are usually warm and clear. The variety of sharks, dolphins, rays, and
          other marine life make it an ideal destination for divers and
          snorkelers. Cocos Island's coral reefs host an array of brightly
          colored fish and crustaceans.
